This includes many non-profits, small businesses, and health care and social service providers, who tend not to think of their anti-union arguments as “union-busting.” Nonetheless, they still hold captive audience meetings where they force workers to listen to arguments against unionization; issue threats that having a union will result in loss of employment; and engage in other tactics to discourage workers from exercising their right to form a union and bargain. This has happened in Bellingham with organizations that receive city money, and will continue to in the absence of sound public policy.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">So, does initiative 3 ban employers from opposing unions?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Certainly not. Employers have the right to discourage employees from joining a union. (Whether this should be the case, and to what degree they should be able to do so, is a matter for Congress to take up.) As a result, Initiative 3 does nothing to impact employers’ right to speak, as they see fit. Initiative 3 is primarily concerned with preventing <em>public money</em> from funding anti-union speech. It remains the fundamental public policy of the United States government, as provided in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, to encourage workers to form unions for collective bargaining. Initiative three provides Bellingham workers with the tools to ensure that their employer segregates any money received from government coffers from that which they use when engaging in anti-union activities. The act imposes no costs on employers who do not engage in anti-union activity and only requires those who do so to ensure government money is not used.</p> </div></div> <a class="ba black-70 br-pill bw1 dib grow ma1 no-underline ph3 pv2" href="#">&uarr; Back to top</a> </h2></section> </div> </article> </body></html>
