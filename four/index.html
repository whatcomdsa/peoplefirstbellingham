for example, the poverty rate for households with children is 11.2 percent with one full-time worker in the household and 27.5 percent with a part-time worker, the poverty rate for Hispanics is 9.4 percent with one full-time worker in the household and 44.1 percent with a part-time worker, and the poverty rate for African-Americans is 6.9 percent with one full-time worker in the household and 55.5 percent with a part-time worker.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, several jurisdictions across the country, including Oregon, California, New York, North Carolina, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and Illinois are considering or have passed scheduling legislation to address the issues faced by employees with unpredictable work schedules and consequently unpredictable income.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, hourly-wage workers deserve predictability in terms of their work schedules.</p> <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF BELLINGHAM DOES ORDAIN:</p> <p><strong>Section 1</strong>.

If additional hours become available, the employer must first attempt to use the access to hours list before hiring externally. The employer may limit the distribution of hours to full shifts. If the employer makes a good faith effort to contact employees on the access to hours list and the employees decline or do not respond to the offer, the employer may then hire externally.

Hazard Pay</p> <ol> <li> <p>If a State of Emergency is declared in any jurisdiction which includes the City of Bellingham, employers shall pay all on-site employees $4 per hour in hazard pay or its equivalent in a prorated salary premium.</p> </li> <li> <p>Businesses with fewer than 30 employees, with the exception of franchises, will only be required to pay a maximum of 14 days of Hazard Pay under this Section per year.</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Section 11</strong>.

Employer Compliance</p> <ol> <li> <p>Employers have an affirmative burden to demonstrate compliance with Article 10. Failure to retain records that demonstrate compliance will be construed against employers.</p> </li> <li> <p>No employer or any other person shall interfere with, restrain, deny, or attempt to deny the exercise of any right protected under this Article 10.</p> </li> <li> <p>No employer or any other person shall take any adverse action against any person because the person has exercised in good faith the rights protected under this Article.

The first part of the law institutes a fair scheduling law that will really help workers balance work and life. The second thing the law does is apply a hazard pay premium of $4/hour for workers who are working on-site during declared states of emergency that include Bellingham. This initiative is good for workers and employers, because workers who can anticipate their schedules and are treated with more fairness and transparency at work are far more likely to be satisfied with their work. This leads to a better workplace environment, and that leads to less turnover in staff, which is also better for businesses.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Why is this important?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Lower-wage workers are more likely to have variable work schedules, making it really difficult to coordinate other aspects of their life, such as childcare and schooling. Aside from basic rules like break times and overtime pay, there aren't a lot of guidelines or standards for how employers can create work schedules with workers in a just and sustainable way. This law institutes scheduling processes that are humane, fair, transparent for ALL workers – not just the few workers lucky enough to have great bosses; and creates more predictability for everyone. Low-wage workers have disproportionately worked in on-site jobs throughout this pandemic. Although there are a few exceptions, the vast majority of these workers <em>have not been compensated</em> for keeping our city running during the pandemic. We have to remedy that, and make sure it can’t happen again! People who make less money tend to incur higher costs for services, and have greater difficulty accessing what they need to be healthy and thriving during an emergency. Bellingham as a whole benefits when more workers are paid hazard pay and have additional spending power. Check out this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/01/25/why-it-costs-so-much-to-be-poor-in-america/">article</a> on how expensive it is to be poor in the U.S.. If you’d like to take your read up on this further, <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/trot/2019/11/27/poverty-is-expensive/">here are some more sources!</a></p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Will initiative 4 hurt small businesses?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>This has been one of the most hotly and publicly debated aspects of Initiative 4. Businesses that have 30 or fewer employees are exempt after only 2 weeks of hazard pay after a state of emergency is declared. The vast majority of businesses in Bellingham have fewer than 30 employees. This is to say, the hazard pay initiative will likely apply to only 10% of Bellingham businesses. The best data on business size comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s survey of County Business Practices. While no data is available on business sizes in Bellingham, it does provide data on businesses in Whatcom County, through 2018. Of the 6819 businesses in Whatcom County, more than 50% have 5 or fewer employees. 88% have 19 or fewer employees. Less than 12% of businesses have 20 or more employees; 562 of these falling between 20 and 50 employees. Some local business owners oppose initiative 4, and they have become the faces of a coordinated campaign against the initiative that has been full of disinformation and innuendo. This opposition campaign is actually being funded by giant corporations through a series of industry trade groups. For example, the <a href="https://wahospitality.org/government-affairs/get-involved/pac/">Washington Hospitality Association</a> has contributed $50,000 to oppose hazard pay for frontline workers. That’s no surprise, as this organization has repeatedly argued against common sense policies like COVID-related public health mandates. These corporations and industry groups care about the profits they return to shareholders, not Bellingham’s low-income workers.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">What about small businesses that are already paying hazard pay?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>While we’ll have to defer this one to the City’s legal team, our guess is that if an employer is already paying hazard pay to employees - as a premium, and not as an increased base wage, it’s likely that this amount of hazard pay would apply toward this initiatives’ $4/hour hazard pay premium. Why? Because it would not be lawful to require businesses to pay the full premium if they were <em>already</em> paying all or part of it. For example, if an employer has already been itemizing their employees’ paychecks with one line for the employee’s base hourly pay, and another separate line for the employee’s hazard pay premium, that means they’d already be fully or partially in compliance. Again, we have to emphasize that the City and its legal team will need to work all of these details out with employers, but our best guess is that if a business is already paying workers temporary hazard pay as <em>hazard pay</em>, and is calling it hazard pay on their workers’ pay stubs/time records very clearly, we think this is a pretty likely outcome.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">What if I don’t want a set schedule?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Section 2.11 states that discussions between the employer and the employee around scheduling may include the proposal of alternatives by the employee and the employer. All workers deserve predictability in their scheduling, but if an employee would <em>prefer</em> to work a changing schedule, and their employer is also OK with that, they can. It certainly doesn’t restrict employees from negotiating a schedule that works for them. What it <em>does</em> do, is create the clear expectation that employers create scheduling processes that give workers advance notice of their schedules, and are open to input from workers on their schedules.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Will this raise my property taxes?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>No. By law, local citizen initiatives in Bellingham cannot raise taxes.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Is the $4/hour hazard pay taxable income?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Yes.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">I’ve heard that the hazard pay section of Initiative 4 is ambiguous or poorly written. Is this true?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>The hazard pay section of Initiative 4 is very simple and straightforward. It is quoted in full below:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Section 10.</strong> Hazard Pay</p> <ol> <li>If a State of Emergency is declared in any jurisdiction <strong>which includes</strong> the City of Bellingham, employers shall pay all <strong>on-site</strong> employees $4 per hour in hazard pay or its equivalent in a prorated salary premium.</li> <li>Businesses with fewer than 30 employees, with the exception of franchises, will only be required to pay a maximum of 14 days of Hazard Pay under this Section per year.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>The initiative is prefaced by a series of “WHEREAS” clauses that offer clear guidance as to the intent of the initiative, which is to ensure that workers exposed to hazards that have been declared a state of emergency, such as a respiratory pandemic, or other unknown future emergency, are compensated for the risks they face when they are required to work on-site in public-facing and aggregate settings.</p></div></div> <h3 class="f3">What about nonprofit organizations?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Numerous Bellingham nonprofits provide services to vulnerable Bellingham residents and essential care to children and people in need of long-term health care. While these businesses do not distribute profits to shareholders (this is what makes them nonprofits), they are still employers. Non-profits with paid staff still have to pay payroll taxes, create and enforce work schedules, and are supposed to abide by wage and hour laws. Their employees deserve no less than any other working people in Bellingham. In fact, many nonprofits in Bellingham have a significant divide between the pay received by their executives and that received by many of their services providers. Many non-profit executives are paid far upwards of $80K per year, with direct service employees (full time 40hrs/week) often paid $24K or less per year. During the pandemic, executive and administrative employees were able to work remotely, while front-line service providers, like YMCA caregivers, front desk-workers, and custodial staff - whose jobs involved being on-site, continued to work in public-facing and group settings.. Many of these institutions have received large donations during the pandemic to help support their services; as well as other public funding under the American Rescue Plan Act that went directly toward subsidizing their costs.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Will I lose my job if Initiative 4 is passed?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Unsurprisingly, we’ve heard that some business owners are intimidating workers and arguing against this initiative by threatening layoffs. This is the same argument businesses have made in almost every fight to improve wage and hour laws over the past century! Although the people leading the resistance to wage laws are usually the bosses, they have often phrased the nature of their concerns in terms of their employees. One argument repeated in nearly every debate has been that higher wages will cause people to lose their jobs. For example, while wage increases can cause job losses under certain conditions, the evidence from studies of state-specific minimum wages has generally defied employers’ doom and gloom predictions. (This <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/minimum-wage-arindrajit-dube-on-economic-impact-of-15-an-hour">Bloomberg article</a> provides a brief summary of some relevant research.) Instead, the overall impact of wage increases tends to produce higher wages for low-income workers and greater prosperity for affected communities. While hazard and general wage increases are very different, we want to clarify for voters that the arguments against both of them are really similar. Opponents of both higher wages and hazard pay – usually business owners, corporations, and PACs – refuse to acknowledge the real value that workers produce, yet expect those workers to create profit, even when it’s at great personal hazard or cost to their workers. That’s obviously not OK. While it’s true we’re still weathering this pandemic, vaccination levels continue to rise and booster shots will become available, as well as vaccinations for kids. It’s likely that we’re almost through this, and we don’t think businesses or non-profits will be paying hazard pay indefinitely! At the same time, the City of Bellingham’s hazard pay resolution left way too many workers behind, and that needs to be remedied for the remainder of this emergency, and for any future emergency that puts workers in danger.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">How will compliance of Initiative 4 be enforced?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>If this law is enacted by voters, the City has an obligation to offer guidance and implementation guidelines to Bellingham employers as to how to comply with the new law, just as it does with all new laws that enter the municipal code. This law will take effect within the context of broader state and federal employment laws. In other words, it will be up to the City of Bellingham to ensure that the law is interpreted and implemented correctly, fairly, and in good faith; both on the basis of the clearly stated intentions in the WHEREAS section of the initiative, as well as how it should function alongside other employment laws. Some examples of other laws that will work alongside this one are wage &amp; hour laws - like overtime and required break times, family and medical leave laws, and laws governing safe workplaces, such as OSHA requirements. The other great thing about this initiative is that requiring employers to pay hazard pay to workers who have to be on-site during an emergency, means that it benefits businesses to take the health of their workers more seriously and really evaluate who actually needs to work on-site and be compensated for that, and who can do their job remotely and stay safe!</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">If there is a state-wide emergency declared, but it does not impact Bellingham, does hazard pay still go into effect? Why?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>As the whereas clauses make clear, the intention of Initiative 4’s Section 10 is that it should apply to hazards that impact on-site employees who have to work in public-facing or aggregate settings. Employees who can work remotely are not the intended beneficiaries of the law. States of emergency are a way of signifying that a relevant hazard exists. If a statewide emergency impacts workers in Bellingham, hazard pay will apply.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Instead of Hazard Pay, can we just fix the wage gap at the local level?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>We’d love to fix the wage gap! BUT, the reality is that every time any kind of wage increase is suggested, these same arguments have been mounted against it. We’ve been weathering a pandemic that took so many of us by surprise, especially in terms of the way it impacted front-line and essential workers. In bringing forth hazard pay in this initiative, we really wanted to think ahead, and be more prepared for the next unknown emergency that might impact workers. We know that with climate disasters and climate shift impacts on the rise, we’re likely to see emergencies that are unprecedented. Thus, the broadness of the hazard pay section: we think the city should have some leeway to exercise judgement as to the particulars of this law’s implementation, and we wanted it to be able to apply to <em>any</em> workers who were required to work on-site during a dangerous and emergency situation. In the case of covid, that was grocery workers, health workers, delivery and postal workers, production and food supply workers, utility workers... We can’t know for sure who the next emergency might affect, but we do know that workers who can work remotely/from home and don’t have to report to a job-site probably won’t be affected.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">What is severability?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Severability means that one section of a law can be struck down (i.e. removed) by the courts without invalidating any other sections of the law. On the text of an actual law, removing a section or phrase <s>looks like this!</s> A line crosses out the part that has been removed. It’s not really that complicated!</p> </div></div> <a class="ba black-70 br-pill bw1 dib grow ma1 no-underline ph3 pv2" href="#">&uarr; Back to top</a> </h2></section> </div> </article> </body></html>
