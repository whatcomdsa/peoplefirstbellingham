According to the American Community Survey, 57% of renting households in Bellingham are cost-burdened (spending more than 30% of household income on housing) with 30% being severely cost-burdened (spending more than 50% of household income on housing).</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, low-income households bear the brunt of high housing costs; of those households making 50% or less of the median income in Whatcom County, 81% are either cost burdened or severely cost burdened.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, renters disproportionately bear the burden of low incomes and high housing costs. Almost 55% of rental households are cost-burdened or severely cost-burdened, as compared to 28% of homeowners. A third of Bellingham renters are severely cost-burdened.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the current rental vacancy rate in Bellingham is among the lowest in the nation. Estimates for the vacancy rate in Fall 2020 varied from .2% to just over 2%, both of which are far below the 5-7% vacancy rate that the City of Bellingham defines as healthy.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, low vacancy rates make it difficult for renters to find decent, safe, affordable housing.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, moving among rentals often requires large sums of money, including first and last month's rent, deposits, moving expenses, and utility deposits for a new residence.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, forced relocation is not merely expensive but puts renters under economic stress that increases their risk of becoming homeless.</p> <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF BELLINGHAM DOES ORDAIN:</p> <p><strong>Section 1</strong>. Amendment to Bellingham, Washington, Municipal Code.</p> <p>Title 6.12.020 to be amended as follows:</p> <p>Any rental agreement or renewal of a rental agreement for a residential rental unit in the City of Bellingham entered into after the effective date of this chapter shall include or shall be deemed to include a provision requiring a minimum of <s>60</s> ==90 days’== prior written notice whenever the periodic or monthly housing costs to be charged a tenant are to increase by <s>10</s> ==5 percent== or more over the periodic or monthly rental rate charged the same tenant for the same housing unit and same services for any period or month during the preceding 12-month period. [Ord. 2018-02-004 § 2].</p> <p><strong>Section 2</strong>. Policy of Rental Relocation Assistance Ordinance:</p> <ol> <li> <p>It is the policy of the City of Bellingham that all residents, regardless of income level, family composition, race, ethnicity or physical ability, have reasonable certainty in their housing, whether publicly assisted or on the private market.</p> </li> <li> <p>Publicly assisted rental housing affordable to low and moderate-income persons and households should be preserved as a long-term resource to the maximum extent practicable, and the tenants of such properties should receive protections to facilitate securing new housing should the affordable units be converted to market-rate units or otherwise be lost as a resource for low and moderate-income housing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bellingham renters in unregulated housing on the private market need additional protections to ensure that there is adequate time to find alternative housing in the case of a no-cause eviction and adequate time to budget for an increase in rent.</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Section 3</strong>.

Exceptions</p> <p>The provisions of this Article do not apply to the following so long as the landlord has submitted a required exemption application form to the City of Bellingham, and the City of Bellingham shall have issued an exemption acknowledgment letter, and the landlord shall have provided a copy of such exemption acknowledgment letter to the tenant.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Rental agreements for week-to-week tenancies;</p> </li> <li> <p>Tenants that occupy the same dwelling unit as the landlord;</p> </li> <li> <p>Tenants that occupy one dwelling unit in a duplex where the landlord’s principal residence is the second dwelling unit in the same duplex;</p> </li> <li> <p>Tenants that occupy an accessory dwelling unit, as defined under Bellingham Municipal Code 20.10.036, so long as the owner of the accessory dwelling unit lives on the site;</p> </li> <li> <p>A landlord that temporarily rents out the landlord's principal residence during the landlord's absence of not more than 3 years;</p> </li> <li> <p>A landlord that temporarily rents out the landlord’s principal residence during the landlord’s absence due to active duty military service;</p> </li> <li> <p>A dwelling unit regulated or certified as affordable housing by a federal, state or local government for a period of at least 60 years is exempt from paying relocation assistance for a rent increase of 8 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period:</p> <ol> <li> <p>so long as such increase does not increase a tenant’s portion of the rent payment by 8 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period; or</p> </li> <li> <p>in lease agreements where the rent or eligibility is periodically calculated based on the tenant’s income or other program eligibility requirements and a rent increase is necessary due to program eligibility requirements or a change in the tenant’s income.

It ensures that when landlords increase rents rapidly, renters have some security as they seek a new rental. The average cost of a one bedroom rental in Bellingham has doubled from $675 to $1,325 since 2014. While rental relocation assistance is not perfectly analogous, landlords already have similar forms of security against their own financial risk. For example, many landlords require renters to provide a security deposit and last month’s rent up front. Renters deserve to have our financial risks protected, too. The city of Portland, Oregon successfully implemented mandatory Renter Relocation Assistance quite similar to our proposed initiative. This law is not overly burdensome for landlords; nor will it slow down the pace of real estate development in Bellingham. By setting the threshold for triggering rental relocation assistance at 8%, the initiative ensures that landlords can still make a healthy profit, afford maintenance, and absorb property tax increases. (Most of us would love to see our gross income increase by anywhere close to 8% per year.)</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Do no-cause evictions happen in Bellingham?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>In May of 2020, after we had already started gathering signatures for initiative #1, Governor Inslee signed HB 1236 into law, which banned no-cause evictions throughout the state. Even still, <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1236&amp;Year=2021&amp;Initiative=false">HB 1236</a> does not address the difficulties renters face when they are priced out of an existing rental. In cases of 8% or more rent increases, relocation assistance is an important step to ensure that the people in our city who are not benefiting from the spectacular rises in the price of housing are protected from displacement. Bellingham rents are continuing to skyrocket, and wages are not keeping up. It’s time we start prioritizing renters over big real estate and landlords in the City.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">I have someone renting my basement, how will I be affected?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Initiative 1 is narrowly tailored to apply primarily to landlords engaged in an income-generating business outside their personal home and exempts many small landlords, including anyone who rents out their basement. Section 9 of Initiative 1 does not apply to landlords in the following situations: - week-to-week rentals - rentals shared with the landlord - rentals in a duplex shared with the landlord - rentals of an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on a property shared with the landlord - rentals of a landlord’s primary residence for 3 years or less or during the landlord’s active military duty - rentals made uninhabitable through no fault of the landlord - rentals certified as affordable housing - and a few other situations that are harder to summarize.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Has anyone else passed Renter Relocation in WA?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Yes! Seattle City Council has voted in favor of relocation assistance with three months rent and six months notice!</p> </div></div> <a class="ba black-70 br-pill bw1 dib grow ma1 no-underline ph3 pv2" href="#">&uarr; Back to top</a> </h2></section> </div> </article> </body></html>
