More than half a dozen U.S. cities have passed bans on the government use of facial recognition.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, police departments employing predictive police technology elsewhere in the United States have not demonstrated a commitment to transparency and public accountability.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the application of predictive policing technology may violate the constitutional requirement that police possess reasonable suspicion before stopping individuals.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Bellingham voters find that advanced policing technologies currently lack the protections needed to adequately safeguard the rights and liberties of all people.</p> <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the propensity for facial recognition technology and predictive policing technology to endanger civil rights and civil liberties substantially outweighs its purported benefits, and the technology will exacerbate racial injustice and threaten our ability to live free of continuous government monitoring.</p> <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY OF BELLINGHAM DOES ORDAIN:</p> <p><strong>Section 1</strong>.

Facial Recognition Technologies give governments, companies, and individuals the power to spy on us wherever we go, enabling the persistent tracking of our faces everywhere there are networked cameras available to either corporations who contract the tech out, law enforcement, or both. This creates the ability to track us in great detail, including at protests, political rallies, places of worship, and more – chilling our democratic rights. After all, we cannot leave our faces at home. The use of facial recognition technology exacerbates the already disproportionate surveillance and criminalization of targeted communities. In this past year alone, we learned of at least 3 Black men who were wrongfully arrested and jailed because facial recognition software matched them to crimes they did not commit. And, it was only after <em>lawsuits</em> were brought in those cases, that the use of facial recognition technology in those wrongful arrests was even disclosed.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Will banning facial recognition technologies (FRT) take away the tools for cops to be able ‘do their jobs’?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Short answer: no, banning FRT will not prevent cops or city employees from doing their jobs. Proponents of these technologies want to make them sound non-threatening, necessary, and helpful; <em>yet no solid data supports that stance</em>. Analysis of facial recognition and predictive policing programs have found them to be ineffective, <em>expensive</em>, and incredibly harmful to marginalized communities. Bellingham should spend money addressing the things that really prevent crime: access to housing, good food, and equity for all. Facial Recognition Technologies, such as Clearview AI, have a demonstrated impact of misidentifying both people of color and women. A study done by MIT found that the technology had a 0.8% error rate on light skinned men and a 34.7% error rate on dark skinned women (<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">MIT Study</a>). There have been multiple misidentifications and wrongful arrests, and the technology is consistently abused by ICE and Border Patrol agents in conjunction with local institutions (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-face-recognition-fuels-racist-systems-of-policing-and-immigration-and-why-congress-must-act-now">ACLU Article</a>), which is not something we think Bellingham should support.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">What is Predictive Policing Technology (PPT)?</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Like facial recognition, predictive policing technologies (PPT) further entrench systemic racism in a self-replicating cycle. Because predictive policing tools use massive amounts of historical crime data to forecast where future criminal activity will take place, they are more accurate at predicting biased policing rather than predicting actual crime. The claim is that PPTs benignly import past crime data to help law enforcement target policing activities to “hot spots” of criminal activity. But, let’s be clear about what that really means: police can continue to target, profile and over-police the same individuals and communities it has in the past. It’s no secret that policing in our country is deeply biased, and this fact has plagued our nation for years. Policing has always dramatically skewed against low-wealth immigrant and communities of color, as well as queer/lgbt communities. Because the past crime data that goes into these technologies is already biased, it – of course – generates results that are also biased. Put another way: garbage in, garbage out. That biased data is then manipulated by authorities and creates further inaccuracies that lead to more over-policing of our neighbors of color (see <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/data-driven-policings-threat-to-our-constitutional-rights/">Brooking Institute Article on Predictive Policing</a>). And that, as we know, can be incredibly harmful, and even deadly. Currently, there is little to no transparency with the public on the exact algorithms and elements contained in the PPT that law enforcement agencies can use– and that is just <em>part</em> of what makes them dangerous. Companies and agencies can draw from all kinds of sources to build their predictive and facial recognition software, including scraping data from people’s facebook profiles, personal blogs, geo-location data to be able to track exactly where a person is at any given time, financial logs, you name it. Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Queer and LGBT, and Immigrant members of our community; activists and social justice organizers; and journalists are all at risk if we do not enact a ban on these invasive technologies. Clearview has continued to collect data and build ever-scarier and creepier tools. If we don’t act now, we may well lose our chance to reign in these civil rights violating practices that are inherent to this kind of technology being employed against us in our daily lives. We believe Bellingham residents deserve a future that is not controlled by the greedy whims of large corporations and agencies that have demonstrated the harms of their deep institutional bias time and time again. We need to pass Initiative 2 to protect our rights and civil liberties.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">More Info</h3> <div class="b--light-silver bl lh-copy pl3"> <h3 class="f3">Only a ban, not weak regulations, can protect Bellingham Residents.</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Only a ban on racially biased and powerful facial recognition technology can protect the civil rights, civil liberties, and safety of Bellingham residents. Washington state’s facial recognition law (SB 6280) is insufficient and allows continued use of this deeply flawed technology. SB 6280 only regulates 3 uses of FRT while many other uses are freely allowed. The bill requires a warrant or court order only for “ongoing surveillance,” “persistent tracking,” and “real-time or near real-time identification.” This means that agencies can use FRT to surveil entire crowds at football stadiums, places of worship, or even on public street corners.   Bellingham is well within its jurisdiction and capability to go above a bill that was never supported by civil liberties proponents. SB 6280 has no preemption provision.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">FRT and PPT fuel abuse of power</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Law enforcement and big corporations have unlimited powers to threaten, harass, harm, detain, inconvenience, and profile people they decide to target based upon predictions and guesses - which we know are prone to human error and bias – instead of actual material evidence of having already committed a crime.   When combined with local, state, and national databases police already use, as well as social media-monitoring, drone surveillance, and stingray (or cell-site simulator) devices, FRT and PP give police unprecedented power to track and target people.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">You won’t know when it’s being used on you</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Currently, there is no way to know whether law enforcement is targeting or stopping someone due to a facial match or a prediction based on the use of predictive software, Most folks who’ve been unjustly stopped due to FRT or PP have only discovered that fact after bringing a lawsuit.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Surveillance always disproportionately harms marginalized communities</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>Past governmental responses to white violence, such as the Oklahoma City bombing and the Columbine shooting, have disproportionately harmed marginalized communities. Government agencies often use crises as an excuse to erode our civil rights and harm our communities.   Examples: 9/11, Patriot Act, Guantanamo Bay, Japanese internment.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">FRT and PPT contribute to recidivism &amp; further targeting folks who have served their time.</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>These technologies contribute to re-incarceration (or recidivism) by continuing to enable the close targeting of those who have served their time for their crime. With the use of these incredibly invasive technologies, these individuals may never be able to be free of the ongoing harassment and surveillance of their lives by law enforcement. This is yet another violation of rights, and makes the rebuilding of one’s life after imprisonment nearly impossible. Given how many people of color are unjustly arrested and jailed in the first place, this leads to a never-ending cycle of bias in our carceral system.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Facial recognition and predictive policing are bad whether or not they are accurate.</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>The technology is not accurate, but even if it was, it would still pose huge threats to our democracy and constitutionally protected rights.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Facial Recognition inaccuracies:</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><ul> <li>While facial recognition harms our democracy regardless of its inaccuracies, it is still extremely inaccurate and biased. Marginal improvements do not eliminate bias.</li> <li>It is up to 100 times more likely to misidentify Black or Asian faces, compared with white faces.   As with most unjust or wrongful stops, the harm and violence they create often goes without remedy.</li> <li>Black women, in particular, are misidentified at significantly higher rates.</li> <li>This technology is even less reliable when identifying transgender individuals and entirely inaccurate when used on non-binary people.  Mismatches at airports and borders also create great risk of harm and harrasessment for non-binary and trans individuals.</li> <li>Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, Nijeer Parks, and Michael Oliver - Black men who were all wrongfully arrested and jailed because face surveillance software matched them to crimes they did not commit.</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Crime forecasting threatens our constitutional rights:</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><ul> <li>Predictive policing systems seek to forecast crime even before it happens, undermining our Fourth Amendment right against “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the police.</li> <li>Even though predictive policing tools are inaccurate and biased, they make it easier for the police to claim that individuals meet the “reasonable suspicion” standard, justifying stops even if no crime has taken place.</li> <li>Predictive policing tools rely on data derived from a long history of discriminatory policing, replicating biased police practices and reinforcing over-policing of communities of color.</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Lack of transparency and accountability = due process concerns</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><ul> <li>We don’t know what data goes in and what decisions/recommendations come out . - There is no way to correct inaccurate or discriminatory decisions (e.g., Robert Julian Borchak Williams being wrongfully arrested due to a false facial recognition match - Detroit MI).   - FRT and PPT create what we might refer to as a “tech-washing” of biased policing patterns. How could a wrongful stop, arrest or assault on a civilian by a law enforcement officer be viewed as biased, if it can be blamed on an algorithm? This poses huge barriers to holding law enforcement accountable for harms they may inflict.</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">FRT does not work well on children &amp; Bellingham does not need it to find missing children</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>There are many studies showing that FRT does not work well on children or elderly people (Dec 2019 NIST study).</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">FRT does not stop human and child trafficking but instead enables mass surveillance of the public &amp; sex workers</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>The use of facial recognition with the purported purpose of halting human trafficking will not be effective in stopping human and child trafficking (face recognition does not work well on children—see above), but could instead enable mass surveillance of the general public, eroding everyone’s privacy and civil liberties, while further marginalizing and harming sex workers, who are disproportionately from LGBTQ, BIPOC and immigrant communities.  Launching mass surveillance efforts to address human trafficking may do much more harm than good, because human trafficking is often conflated with consensual sex work. This inaccurate conflation not only does not help legitimate victims of human trafficking, but also harms the diverse sex worker community.</p> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Major flaws in data</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><ul> <li>Over-policed areas yield higher crime data. This creates a never-ending data loop.</li> <li>Communities that are already over-policed yield higher crime data, which predictive policing technologies then leverage into more over-policing, a cycle that all but guarantees inequity in community safety.</li> <li>Police are likely to make mistakes using these flawed and biased technologies - opening up possibilities for injury, harm, corruption and cover up, and/or very expensive lawsuits against the city.</li> <li>Algorithms can’t best human emotional intelligence or relational understanding - they’re very likely to make flawed predictions based on the limited and overly-objective set of facts (data) they are written and machine-taught to process. This is the human vs robot dilemma!</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Dangers of Data retention</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><ul> <li>The data these tools employ and collect is used by federal agencies, but local police are the one’s collecting it.</li> <li>Police shouldn’t be able to use biased technology, or the data generated by that technology. We don’t want Bellingham police to ask other agencies / companies to use harmful technology on their behalf.</li> <li>Using discriminatory policing data simply leads to more discrimination in communities that are already harmed by over-policing .</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">FRT &amp; PPT enable an all-seeing view of people’s travels in real time, with very real concerns for the harm this may create.</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><ul> <li>Stalking of people by law enforcement.</li> <li>Many cases of intimate partner violence abuse by law enforcement.</li> <li>Geolocation tracking aspects of FRT and PPT gives law enforcement an intimate portrait of people’s lives--from where they live and work, to what religion they practice, the health clinic they visit, and the family and friends they associate with. This has an incredible chilling effect on people’s freedom of movement and association, as well as potential to chill free speech by creating conditions in which people are afraid to attend public assemblies.</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 class="f3">Key exceptions to this ban</h3> <div class="lh-copy"><div class="md-block"><p>It’s important to point out that Initiative 2 will ban the use of these invasive technologies, and the data they collect, by the City of Bellingham for at least two years. However, pressing “STOP” on the use of this tech by our City doesn’t mean they cannot be used by state and federal agencies.</p> </div></div> </div> <a class="ba black-70 br-pill bw1 dib grow ma1 no-underline ph3 pv2" href="#">&uarr; Back to top</a> </h2></section> </div> </article> </body></html>
